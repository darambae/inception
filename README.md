## Introduction

Inception is a Docker-based project where the goal is to create a secure web infrastructure consisting of NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB, each running in its own container. This project, part of the Ecole 42 curriculum, teaches fundamental concepts of system administration, containerization, and networking.

## Features

- Multi-container Docker setup for a complete web service stack.
- Secure NGINX configuration with SSL support.
- Persistent data storage using Docker volumes for MariaDB and WordPress.
- Network isolation between containers for added security.
